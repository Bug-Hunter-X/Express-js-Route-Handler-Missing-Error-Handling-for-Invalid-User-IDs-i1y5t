# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  missing error handling for invalid input.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code.  It attempts to find a user based on an ID passed in the URL parameters.  However, it lacks proper error handling if the `userId` is not a valid integer.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  It checks if the `userId` is a valid integer and handles the case where the user is not found.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in Express.js applications to prevent unexpected behavior and crashes.
